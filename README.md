# Regression

In this repository, you will be able to identify and import the Python modules required for regression analysis; use the pandas module to load a dataset and prepare it for regression analysis; create a scatter plot of bivariate data and fit a regression line through it; use the methods available in the Python statsmodels module to fit a regression model to a dataset; explain the results of simple and multiple linear regression analysis; assess the goodness of fit of a linear regression model; and apply linear regression analysis as a tool for practical problem-solving.

This lesson is an introduction to linear regression analysis and its application to practical problem-solving in data science. You will learn how to use Python, a versatile programming language, to carry out regression analysis and examine the results. The use of the logarithm function to transform inherently non-linear relationships between variables and to enable the application of the linear regression method of analysis will also be introduced.

# Introduction

The previous lesson provided a primer to Python programming and an overview of the data science field. Data science is a relatively young multidisciplinary field of study. It draws its concepts and methods from the traditional fields of statistics, computer science, and the broad field of artificial intelligence (AI), especially the subfield of AI called machine learning:
